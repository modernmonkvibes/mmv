> Your mental health should be your top priority

### Make sleep part of your self-care routine
Sleep can have a huge effect on how you feel both emotionally and physically.

Not getting enough can even cause major health issues.

But stress and other distractions can wreak havoc on our sleep.

### Exercise daily as part of your self-care routine.
Daily exercise can help you both physically and mentally.

Boosting your mood and reducing stress and anxiety, not to mention helping you shed extra weight.

### Say no to others, and say yes to your self-care.
Learning to say no is really hard, many of us feel obligated to say yes when someone asks for our time or energy.

It may take a little practice, but once you learn how to politely say no.

### Take a self-care break by getting outside.
Getting outside can also help you sleep better at night, especially if you do some physical activity, like gardening, hiking, or walking while you are outside.

### Take care of yourself by getting organized.
Getting organized is often the first step to becoming a healthier you because it allows you to figure out exactly what you need to do to take better care of yourself.
