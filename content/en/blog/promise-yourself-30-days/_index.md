Let’s keep it simple.
You want to improve yourself and willing to become a better person tomorrow.

That sounds great and it’s a wonderful thought.  What you do next is something actually matters.

## Two choices are available:
1. Think more
2. Start from today.

  

### Option 1- Think more

You will get into the flow of keep thinking, or probably you will also think that let me finalize what I want to become first. Honestly, it’s a serious concern if that’s taking you more than a day. You are escaping from hard work and enjoying the comfort of keep thinking. Since you are still in the thinking process, you will never feel that you not making progress but in reality, you are still in the same old place. Delusion or making progress

  
### Option 2- Start from today

You can spend a day writing a list of items you want to work on for the next 30 days. It can be 5-10 or based on your comfort level. The next day, when you get up, you HAVE to work on those things you list down. It may not be in a perfect state but you can always and always improvise on them. Working towards your goal sooner, defines everything and reduces overthinking. It will eventually lead to great confidence and a positive mindset.

 
### In Summary: Please start early and improvise as you go.
